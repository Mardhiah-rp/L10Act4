What is my app about?

I developed a simple, cozy bakery-themed menu list app that displays menu items from my small home-based business.
It displays the menu in sectioned categories in an aesthetic and interactive layout. When a card product is tapped, the card expands and shows th eproduct description.
I made the layout of the cards to be alternating left-right layout to recreate a aesthetic menu styled theme. 
I used a component that handles image rendering, alternating layout and expandable/collapsable description.
